## About This Project

This project is a YouTube homepage clone built as part of the HTML & CSS Full Course by SuperSimpleDev on YouTube.
It demonstrates key front-end development skills including:

- **Nested layouts** using div elements to organize the page structure and group related content effectively
- **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid** to build a responsive structure that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Media Queries (@media)** to change layout structure and styling for diffferent device widths
- Structuring a real-world layout with **header, sidebar, and video previews**
- Proper use of **positioning (relative, absolute, fixed)** to handle the header, sidebar, and video contents, including hover-triggered tooltips displaying profile details

The goal was to recreate the visual layout of YouTube's homepage using clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS practices.
